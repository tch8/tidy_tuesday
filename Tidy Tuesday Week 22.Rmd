### Read in Data 
```{r}
records <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/records.csv')
drivers <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/drivers.csv')
```

### Filter the Data

```{r}
records_filtered <- records %>% 
  filter(type == "Three Lap", shortcut == "No") %>%
  group_by(track, system_played) %>%
  summarise(recordtime = min(time, na.rm = TRUE))
```


### Data Visualization

**Research question: Which track is the fastest during a three lap, no shortcuts race?**

```{r}
records_filtered %>%
  ggplot(mapping = 
           aes(x = recordtime, y = track, fill = system_played)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  xlab("Record Minimum Time") + 
  labs(fill = "System Played", 
       title = "Record Time by Track for Mario Kart 64", 
       y= NULL, 
       subtitle = "Record times are Three Lap and No Shortcuts", 
       caption = "Plot created by Talia, data from Mario Cart World Records") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  theme_minimal()
```
